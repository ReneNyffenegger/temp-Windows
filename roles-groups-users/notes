Local System
------------
  Completely trusted account, moreso than the administrator account. 

  There is nothing on a single box that this account can not do
  -
  "...From a security perspective, the local system account is extremely powerful - more powerful than any domain or local account."

  Most services run in the security context of the local system account (displayed sometimes as SYSTEM and other times as LocalSystem)

  It has the right to access the network as the machine (this requires Active Directory and granting the machine account permissions to something)
  It acts as the computer on the network.

  The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager.

  This account is not recognized by the security subsystem, so you cannot specify its name in a call to the LookupAccountName function.

  Local System is a very high-privileged built-in account.

  The local system account is the same account in which core Windows user-mode
  operating system components run, including the Session Manager (smss.exe),
  the Windows subsystem process (csrss.exe), the Local Security Authority
  process (lsass.exe), and the Logon process (winlogon.exe).


  "
   LocalSystem is the exact same thing as "NT Authority\System".  They are synonyms.

   System is a separate entity that happens to share some (confusion generating) characteristics
  " 


  Tokens
  ------
    Its token includes the
      - NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and
      - BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs

    These  accounts have access to most system objects. 

    The name of the account in all locales is .\LocalSystem
    LocalSystem or ComputerName\LocalSystem



NT Authority\System = Local System = SYSTEM = S-1-5-18
