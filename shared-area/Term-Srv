   Change Remote Desktop Port
   
   Default Remote Desktop Port: 3389
   
   For each computer you want to remotely connect to you have to configure each computer to listen to different ports to avoid port conflicts by changing the registry key in
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TerminalServer\WinStations\RDP-Tcp\PortNumber
   
   START > RUN > REGEDIT
   
   Navigate thru:
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > System > CurrentControlSet > Control > TerminalServer > WinStations > RDP-Tcp
   
   Then locate the following registry subkey:
   
   PortNumber
   
   On the Edit menu, click Modify, and then on the Edit DWORD Value click Decimal which will show us the exact port number.
   
   Note: To avoid conflict with other programs it is suggested to select a port between 49152 and 65535.
   
   Now take that number you've chosen your computer to listen to and configure your router to port forward to that number
   
   To connect to that computer your format will now be IP:Port
   (ex. 222.222.222.222:1234) to connect to that specific computer behind the router
   
   Important: If you have a firewall software running, that too has to be configured to allow communication to the port you opened in your router as well.
