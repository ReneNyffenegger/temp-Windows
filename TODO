  To enable per-user quotas, you can create subkeys under the
  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Session Manager\Quota System registry key, each one representing a
  given user SID. The values mentioned previously can then be created under this specific SID subkey,
  enforcing the limits only for the processes created by that user. Table 5-9 shows how to configure these
  values (which can be done at run time or not) and which privileges are required.

When the system boots, the Session Manager process (Smss.exe) reads the list of page files to open by
examining the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
Management\PagingFiles registry value.

    http://ins3cure.blogspot.com/2012/04/lsa-secrets.html
  Each secret (key) in HKLM\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets contains the data in
  CurrVal sub-key. For example on systems with auto logon enabled, there is a
  key DefaultPassword that contains the password cached. For some reasons this
  key already exists (with the password also) even on some systems without auto
  logon (I had that key on a Windows XP SP3, and I have never had auto login,
  so I couldn't find out why and when this key is created). 

  A method to (try  to) get the logon password (used by lots of tools also) is to query the value from DefaultPassword key.




HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security\Policy\Secrets
  There are lot of other Lsa secret strings which are present at below registry location
    https://securityxploded.com/defaultpassword.php

  LSA secrets are stored in the SECURITY hive of the registry, in the key SECURITY\Policy\Secrets.
  Under that key, each secret has its own key, so NL$KM can be found at SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\NL$KM. 
     http://moyix.blogspot.com/2008/02/decrypting-lsa-secrets.html
     -
     Each secret key then has several subkeys associated with it: CurrVal,
     CupdTime, OldVal, OupdTime, and SecDesc. CurrVal and Oldval are the
     current and previous values of the secret, and CupdTime and OupdTime are
     the respective timestamps when the values were updated, as 64-bit
     FILETIMEs. SecDesc is assumed to be a security descriptor for the secret,
     but I have not verified this empirically.


  Values
   NL$xx           -> Only NT 4 and earlier: cached logon credentials
   NL$KM           -> Key material to generate an encryption key / random string for each computer
   DPAPI_SYSTEM
   _SC_SerivceName -> Password for specific service.
                      Username is stored under HKLM\system\CurrentControlSet\Services\_ServiceName_\Security 
   $MACHINE.ACC    -> Only for computers that are domain members: the computer's password in the domain
   G$$DomainName   ->

lsass.exe
   http://moyix.blogspot.com/2008/02/decrypting-lsa-secrets.html
     Perusing this code shows that the author obtained the secret decryption key
     by searching the memory space of lsass.exe for the string
     "\x10\x00\x00\x00\x10\x00\x00\x00"; this is because the key was known to be
     16 bytes, and it is contained in a data structure whose first two fields are
     little-endian integers giving the current and maximum size of the contained
     data. Crude as this method is, it has worked in every case I have tried it,
     and it works well enough that the author of CacheDump uses it in his utility
     to decrypt the value of NL$KM.

      Some Googling and poking through the Wine source code gives us some initial
      information: SystemFucntion005 apparently decrypts a variable-length block
      of data using DES in ECB mode (the relevant code can be found in
      dlls/advapi32/crypt_lmhash.c.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECUIRITY\Policy\Secrets\DefaultPassword

    the DefaultPassword key is of course the encrypted version of the Autologon password as set by for example the SysInternals Autologon tool. I really should have known that…

    the key you describe here is used by autologon (from sys internals) when you configure an autologon account. This must correspond with the autologon options in HKLM\software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\currentversion\WinLogon

Domains
  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/175468/effects-of-machine-account-replication-on-a-domain
     For each Windows computer that is a member of a domain, there is a discrete communication channel with a domain controller.

     An example of a discrete communication channel is the security channel.

     The security channel's password is stored together with the computer account
     on the primary domain controller (PDC), and is replicated to all backup
     domain controllers (BDCs). The password is also in LSA secret $MACHINE.ACC of
     the workstation. Each workstation owns such secret data.
